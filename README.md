 SmartTransit AI is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to optimize public bus transport in urban cities like
 Coimbatore by forecasting passenger demand and dynamically adjusting bus schedules
 Developed an AI-powered bus scheduling system using LSTM for demand forecasting and DQN for dynamic route
 allocation based on real-time data.
 Integrated a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing predicted passenger demand, scheduling insights, and enabling transport
 officer interaction.
 The system blends deep learning and reinforcement learning to offer real-time, context-aware scheduling recommendations
